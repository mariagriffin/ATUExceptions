**Coding Challenge: File Processing and Data Manipulation**

This is a small Java application that processes a text file containing student names and their scores in a subject, separated by commas (e.g., "John Doe, 85"). The application should read the file, calculate the average score of all students, and write the result to a new file. Additionally, the application must handle various exceptions that may arise during the process.

## Requirements:

**File Reading and Writing**
The code will : 
  # Read from a file named students.txt.
  # Write the average score to a file named average_score.txt.
**Data Processing**
  # Parse each line to extract the student's score.
  # Calculate the average score of all students.
**Exception Handling**
**You need to complete the rest: **
  # Handle FileNotFoundException if the input file does not exist.
  # Handle IOException for other IO errors.
  # Handle NumberFormatException if the score is not a valid integer.
  # Implement a custom exception called InvalidDataFormatException that is thrown when a line does not follow the expected format ("Name, Score").

## Cleanup
  # Ensure that all resources (e.g., file readers and writers) are properly closed, regardless of whether an exception occurs.
